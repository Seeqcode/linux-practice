# Linux practice
This is the beginning of my Devops journey using Termux on Android.
I'm learning Git, linux commands and scripting one day at a time.

What i am learning.
1. Linux terminal commands
2. Git and Github
3. Python automation

Why this repo exists?

This is my daily practice log while learning DevOps and automation using nothing but my android phone.
LOL.
